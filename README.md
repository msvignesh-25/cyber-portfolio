# Cybersecurity Portfolio – M S Vignesh

This repository serves as a centralized index of my hands-on cybersecurity work.
It focuses on building strong fundamentals required for offensive security and
red teaming through practical labs, CTF challenges, and independent learning.

## 🧪 Hands-On Work

### 🔹 CTF Writeups
- **picoCTF Writeups**  
  Practical challenges covering binary exploitation, web vulnerabilities,
  and cryptography with emphasis on understanding the underlying concepts.  
  → https://github.com/msvignesh-25/picoctf-writeups

- **OverTheWire Writeups**  
  Focused on Linux internals, permissions, command-line proficiency,
  and foundational privilege escalation concepts.

---

## Areas of Focus
- Networking fundamentals (OSI, TCP/IP, routing, protocols)
- Linux system internals and privilege escalation concepts
- Web application security (learning phase)
- Offensive security fundamentals and attacker mindset
- Challenge-based learning through CTFs
- Python scripting for basic automation

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Linux (command line)
- Bash
- Python
- Git & GitHub
- GDB (introductory usage)
- Burp Suite (learning phase)

---

## Learning Approach
- Focuses on understanding root causes rather than memorizing solutions
- Avoids copy-paste walkthrough-based learning
- Documents reasoning and lessons learned during problem solving
- Emphasizes consistency and long-term skill development

---

## 🧭 Learning Roadmap (Current)

The following roadmap reflects my near-term learning priorities and is updated
as I progress.

- Strengthen networking fundamentals from a security perspective
- Improve web exploitation methodology through hands-on challenges
- Develop a deeper understanding of Linux privilege escalation
- Begin structured practice in binary exploitation concepts
- Build small Python scripts to automate repetitive security tasks

## 📌 Purpose
This repository acts as a single, organized entry point to my cybersecurity work,
without mixing raw notes or writeups inside this index. Each linked repository
contains focused, hands-on practice aligned with my learning goals.
